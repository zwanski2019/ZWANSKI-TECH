## Gravatar Profiles

When you enter an email address to look up a Gravatar image, the address is hashed locally in your browser using MD5 and the hash is sent to the Gravatar service. We do not store the email address or the resulting hash on our servers. The entered email never leaves your device except for the hashed request to Gravatar. All requests are made over HTTPS to protect the data in transit.

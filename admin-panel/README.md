# Zwanski Admin Panel

This directory contains a standalone admin panel for managing content on **zwanski.org**. It is a lightweight React + Vite application that connects directly to the existing Supabase backend.

## Features

- Secure login via Supabase authentication
- Placeholder dashboard for future management tools (blog posts, services, courses, marketplace content, static pages, media uploads, and site settings)

## Development

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

The panel is intentionally separated from the main site so it can be deployed to a different route such as `admin.zwanski.org`.
